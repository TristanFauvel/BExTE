## NAMESPACE and man/ are generated from the roxygen blocks in R/, while the
## reference index in _pkgdown.yml is maintained by hand. Nothing in an R
## session reads any of them, so when they drift apart the only thing that
## notices is a pkgdown build - which publishes the site, and fails long after
## the commit that broke it. Both directions had already drifted on main:
## vs_tie_legend_text carried an @export that NAMESPACE had never been
## regenerated to include, and NAMESPACE still exported
## operating_characteristic_vs_tie although no roxygen block was left to
## document it - so the next devtools::document() deleted its help topic and
## took the docs build down with it, because _pkgdown.yml still pointed there.
