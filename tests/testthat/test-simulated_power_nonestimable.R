## The frequentist baselines are simulated whenever the endpoint is not
## continuous. Mepolizumab used to be the exception, priced in closed form
## although its trials are generated patient by patient from a negative
## binomial, so its baselines assumed a test the Bayesian methods were never
## compared against.
##
## A simulated trial can also have no estimable summary measure - a
## recurrent-event arm with no event at all. It has no p-value, and before it
## was dropped a single such replicate turned the whole simulated power into
## NA. The Bayesian operating characteristics leave those replicates out of
## their denominator, and the baselines now do the same.
