## Selecting the parameter combination a figure plots is done by merging the
## results against a one-row data frame of the wanted parameter values.
##
## The merge has to be handed that data frame itself. Writing
## `parameters_combinations[, ]` drops a SINGLE-column frame to a bare vector,
## and merge() then has no column in common to join on: it either cross-joins,
## keeping every parameter value, or returns nothing when a name happens to
## collide. Figure S3 plots the conditional power prior at gamma = 0.25 and is
## the only manifest entry whose selection has exactly one parameter, which is
## why all five of its gamma values were drawn joined into one zig-zagging
## line while two-parameter figures like S4 were fine.
